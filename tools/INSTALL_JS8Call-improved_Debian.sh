echo "NOTES:
The newest versions of JS8Call require Qt v6.9.3 to run correctly. Most
linux distributions do not package Qt6.9.3. The JS8Call project has pre-compiled
Qt6.9.3 libraries that this script will fetch and install. This will not affect 
whatever version of Qt you have installed from your distribution.
The two versions can co-exist and JS8Call will be linked with the
Qt6.9.3 installation, which will be in your ~/.local/lib/Qt directory.

If you run this script a second time after installation, it will ask if you want
to uninstall JS8Call. The installation of Qt6.9.3 will also be removed
during uninstall. But during build the Qt6.9.3 library archive that will be downloaded
will be saved in your Downloads folder. If you don't wish to keep it, delete it.

This script has been tested on Debian 12/13 and Mint but should also work on
Ubuntu 24.

The JS8Call menu item is tested with Gnome. It should
work on KDE since linux desktops are supposed to follow the conventions laid out
by freedesktop.org but this seems to be not always the case. If you don't get a
menu item on KDE et al under the Other category, the binary is installed to ~/.local/bin
where you can symlink it, place the symlink in a convenient location (like maybe the
desktop) and use it to launch the program. With KDE it seems you have to log out and log
back in to refresh the menus. With the standard Gnome desktops the menu item will appear
in the launcher automatically."

echo "AUDIO:
Newer versions of Qt use FFmpeg audio backend. ALSA audio is deprecated. If you
are running an older version of JS8Call(2.2) it might be using ALSA backend. There will
be no audio on a Linux system with JS8Call-2.3 and later unless it is using PipeWire or
PulseAudio. When you start up JS8Call it will use your current JS8Call settings
if you have an existing installation. There is some incompatibility with audio and text
encoding between JS8Call 2.2 (Fortran/Qt5) and 2.3 and newer (C++/Qt6)."

echo -e "The next step will install system dependencies as a sudo user. Since Debian
systems do not add a user to sudo by default, and if you have not added yourself
to the sudo group, you must do so now by running (as root)

Copy and paste this command into your terminal if necessary and replace
${red}your_username${clear} with your login username:
${red}usermod -aG sudo your_username${clear}

With Debian you will have to reboot your machine for your username to be added to sudo.
Logging out and logging back in doesn't do the trick."
